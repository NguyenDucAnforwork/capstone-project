# Pygame Othello for Capstone Project
Or Pygello, because... y'know, Pygame and Othello... ahahaha, yeah I'll see myself out.

## What is this?
A Pygame implementation of the game Othello. We made this and added several
features to support researching purposes.

Aside from playing Othello, this program is also capable of recording and
replaying games.
<br>
<br>

## Getting started
'How can I use this', you ask. Here are a few simple things you need to do:
- Fork, clone, download, or do whatever to get this repo on your local machine
- Have Python 3.12 installed (or updated) (very advisable)
- Install those in `requirements.txt`
- Run `main.py`

Other than that, the menu's navigations is pretty self-explanatory.

<br>

## Basic adjustments
This part was obliterated due to the help of `pygame-menu` lol, no need to tinker
the code now as all things can be adjusted with Game Menu.
<br>
<br>

## Advanced adjustments
Head to `heuristics.py` and add your own heuristics / evaluating functions!

In accordance with the indicated guidelines at the beginning of the file, of course.
<br>
<br>

## To be added *very* soon
- [x] More heuristics
- [ ] Improve game record/rollback method (ongoing)
- [ ] Folder for papers, etc. (should be done soon)
- [ ] nope nope nope
- [ ] Auto recording moves of external engines with mss and opencv (hell no this hard)
