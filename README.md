# Pygame Othello for Capstone Project
Or Pygello, because... y'know, Pygame and Othello... ahahaha, yeah I'll see myself out.

## What is this?
A Pygame implementation of the game Othello. We made this and added several
features to support researching purposes.

Aside from playing Othello, this program is also capable of recording and
replaying games.
<br>
<br>

## Getting started
'How can I use this', you ask. Here are a few simple things you need to do:
- Fork, clone, download, or do whatever to get this repo on your local machine
- Have Python 3.12 installed (or updated) (very advisable)
- Install those in `requirements.txt` (will add later, trust)
- Run `main.py`
<br>
<br>

## Adjustments
This part was obliterated due to the help of `pygame-menu` lol, no need to tinker
the code now as all things can be adjusted with Game Menu.

## To be added *very* soon
- [ ] More heuristics (somebody quick)
- [ ] Improve game record/rollback method (ongoing)
- [ ] Folder for papers, etc. (should be done soon)
- [ ] nope
- [ ] Auto recording moves of external engines with mss and opencv (hell no this hard)
